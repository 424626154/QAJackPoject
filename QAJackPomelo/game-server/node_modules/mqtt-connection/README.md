mqtt-connection&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mqttjs/mqtt-connection.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mqttjs/mqtt-connection)
===============

Barebone Connection object for MQTT.
Works over any kind of binary Streams, TCP, TLS, WebSocket, ...

It uses [mqtt-packet](http://npm.im/mqtt-packet) for generating and
parsing MQTT packets. See it for the full documentations on the
packet types.

This library is tested with node v4 and v6. The last version to support
older versions of node was mqtt-connection@2.1.1.

Install
-------

```sh
npm install mqtt-connection --save
```

Usage
-----

As a client:

```js
var net     = require('net')
  , mqttCon = require('mqtt-connection')
  , stream  = net.createConnection(1883, 'localhost')
  , conn    = mqttCon(stream);

// conn is your MQTT connection!

```

As a server:
```js
var net     = require('net')
  , mqttCon = require('mqtt-connection')
  , server  = new net.Server();

server.on('connection', function(stream) {
  var conn = mqttCon(stream);

  // conn is your MQTT connection!
});
```

As a websocket server:

```js
var websocket = require('websocket-stream')
  , WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server
  , Connection = require('mqtt-connection')
  , server = http.createServer()

function attachWebsocketServer(server, handler) {
  var wss = new WebSocketServer({server: server})

  if (handler)
    server.on('client', handler)

  wss.on('connection', function(ws) {
    var stream = websocket(ws)
    var connection = new Connection(stream)

    server.emit("client", connection)
  })

  return server
}

attachWebsocketServer(server)
```

### new mqtt.Connection([options])

Creates a new MQTT `Connection`.

Options:

  * `notData`: do not listen to the `'data'` event, so that it can
    respect backpressure. Pipe the `Connection` to another stream to
    consume the packets. If this option is passed `true` the object will
    emit no packet-related events.

#### Connection#connect(options, [callback])

Send an MQTT connect packet.

`options` supports the following properties:

* `protocolId`: Protocol ID, usually `MQIsdp`. `string`
* `protocolVersion`: Protocol version, usually 3. `number`
* `keepalive`: keepalive period in seconds. `number`
* `clientId`: client ID. `string`
* `will`: the client's will message options.
`object` that supports the following properties:
  * `topic`: the will topic. `string`
  * `payload`: the will payload. `string`
  * `qos`: will qos level. `number`
  * `retain`: will retain flag. `boolean`
* `clean`: the 'clean start' flag. `boolean`
* `username`: username for protocol v3.1. `string`
* `password`: password for protocol v3.1. `string`

#### Connection#connack(options, [callback])
Send an MQTT connack packet.

`options` supports the following properties:

* `returnCode`: the return code of the connack, success is
indicated by `0`. `number`

#### Connection#publish(options, [callback])
Send an MQTT publish packet.

`options` supports the following properties:

* `topic`: the topic to publish to. `string`
* `payload`: the payload to publish, defaults to an empty buffer.
`string` or `buffer`
* `qos`: the quality of service level to publish on. `number`
* `messageId`: the message ID of the packet,
required if qos > 0. `number`
* `retain`: retain flag. `boolean`

#### Connection#puback #pubrec #pubcomp #unsuback(options, [callback])
Send an MQTT `[puback, pubrec, pubcomp, unsuback]` packet.

`options` supports the following properties:

* `messageId`: the ID of the packet

#### Connection#pubrel(options, [callback])
Send an MQTT pubrel packet.

`options` supports the following properties:

* `dup`: duplicate message flag
* `messageId`: the ID of the packet

#### Connection#subscribe(options, [callback])
Send an MQTT subscribe packet.

`options` supports the following properties:

* `dup`: duplicate message flag
* `messageId`: the ID of the packet
* `subscriptions`: a list of subscriptions of the form
`[{topic: a, qos: 0}, {topic: b, qos: 1}]`

#### Connection#suback(options, [callback])
Send an MQTT suback packet.

`options` supports the following properties:

* `granted`: a vector of granted QoS levels,
of the form `[0, 1, 2]`
* `messageId`: the ID of the packet

#### Connection#unsubscribe(options, [callback])
Send an MQTT unsubscribe packet.

`options` supports the following properties:

* `messageId`: the ID of the packet
* `dup`: duplicate message flag
* `unsubscriptions`: a list of topics to unsubscribe from,
of the form `["topic1", "topic2"]`

#### Connection#pingreq #pingresp #disconnect(options, [callback])
Send an MQTT `[pingreq, pingresp, disconnect]` packet.

#### Event: 'connect'
`function(packet) {}`

Emitted when an MQTT connect packet is received by the client.

`packet` is an object that may have the following properties:

* `version`: the protocol version string
* `versionNum`: the protocol version number
* `keepalive`: the client's keepalive period
* `clientId`: the client's ID
* `will`: an object with the following keys:
  * `topic`: the client's will topic
  * `payload`: the will message
  * `retain`: will retain flag
  * `qos`: will qos level
* `clean`: clean start flag
* `username`: v3.1 username
* `password`: v3.1 password

`packet` is an object that may contain the properties:

* `messageId`: the ID of the packet
* `granted`: a vector of granted QoS levels

#### Event: 'unsubscribe'
`function(packet) {}`

<a name="generateStream">
### mqtt.generateStream()

Returns a `Transform` stream that calls [`generate()`](https://github.com/mqttjs/mqtt-packet#generate).
The stream is configured into object mode.

<a name="parseStream">
### mqtt.parseStream(opts)

Returns a `Transform` stream that embeds a [`Parser`](https://github.com/mqttjs/mqtt-packet#mqttparser) and calls [`Parser.parse()`](https://github.com/mqttjs/mqtt-packet#parserparsebuffer) for each new `Buffer`. The stream is configured into object mode. It accepts the same options of [`parser(opts)`](#parser).
